# Coffee Machine Project

This project is a Python-based graphical coffee machine simulator. It allows users to choose from various coffee drinks, customize their orders with add-ons, and calculate the total cost. The system also keeps track of ingredient resources and allows for manager-level access to check revenue and refill resources.

## Motivation

This mini project was inspired by my daily coffee routine during my internship. Each morning and evening, I would grab a cup of coffee, which fueled me to tackle my daily tasks. I wanted to recreate that experience with a fun and interactive coffee machine simulator, using Python to make the process feel both nostalgic and productive.

## Features

- Graphical User Interface: Built with tkinter, allowing easy navigation and interaction.
- Menu Items: Offers coffee options like Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino, Americano, and Mocha.
- Add-ons: Customize your coffee with extras like whipped cream, caramel, extra shots, and vanilla syrup.
- Cost Calculation: Automatically calculates the total cost of your order based on the selected coffee and add-ons.
- Resource Management: Tracks the available quantities of ingredients such as water, milk, coffee, and more.
- Manager Access: A password-protected section allows the manager to check revenue and manage ingredient levels.
